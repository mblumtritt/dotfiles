remove the lint
count the breadcrumbs
fluff the pillows
put things in order
light up the dark corners
connect A with B
check under the cupboard
count paper clips
organize data
hold your breath longer
complain about the weather
be happy about the weather
keep the ball rolling
take out the garbage
look at things in a different light
regulate the caffeine level
